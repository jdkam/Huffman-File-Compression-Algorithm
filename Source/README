This is the Huffman Tree compression/decompression algorithm. It was last tested and working on Linux, using g++ 
compiler and the included makefile.
Use the testdriver file to run the code.
In linux command terminal you can type:

"./huff -c filename.txt outputfilename" for compression

or 

"./huff -d filename.huff outputfilename.txt" for decompression
